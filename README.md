# AerialMapping-UI
The UI and path-planning pre-proccesor for Aerial Mapping, an open source drone software toolkit designed to assist humanitarian groups in reconnaissance, rescue and data analysis. 

Current progress in the UI:
 - Home point chosen based on location of click, rather than on the grid

Features to work on:
 - Search bar for Google Map API
 - Additional readibility (i.e. camera selector, better styling, etc.)
 - Full integration with path planner matlab script
